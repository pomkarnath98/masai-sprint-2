A Snake &amp; Ladders Game for Kids

How to play:

Each player enter their name on the space that says 'Player1 (Max length: 9)' and 'Player2 (Max length: 9)' respectively.
By clicking on 'START' each player puts their counter on the space that says '1'.
Follow the instructions whose turn to roll dice and as the turn, roll the dice. Move your counter forward the number of spaces shown on the dice.
If your counter lands at a ladder, you can move up to the number next to 'ladder->' automatically.
If your counter lands at a snake, you can move up to the number next to 'snake->' automatically.
The first player to get to the space that says '100' is the winner.

Have fun!
